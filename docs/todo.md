# Inventory:

- [ ] Right now you must click in the first tile of an object, we want to check against the whole rect
- [ ] Instead of click to select and again to move the item, implement drag and drop
- [ ] Give real time feedback to user about wether you can succesfully drop an item...
    

Random ideas that we don't have time for but would be seriously cool:

- You do not actually control a ship, but a shipping company, which in turns buys ships and hires captains and other crewmates
- You only control your flagship, but you may have other ships which generate some revenue for you based on routes you give them
- If a ship is sunk, you lose it but may retain the captain (or other surviving crew members) and can buy new ships for them
- A crew that loses enough morale may try to commit a mutiny. If succesfull, the player loses control of the ship, which then becomes independent
- Scurvy and/or other diseases should be a thing
- In addition to captains you should be able to hire chefs (prevent scurvy, consume less food), doctors (lose less crew), navigators (navigation bonus) and tacticians (battle bonus)
- There is a stock market on which you can buy stocks in other players shipping companies
- Ghost ships should be a thing?
- Seamonsters in the deep sea should be a thing?
- Its not really a pirate game without treasure?
- We want different type of guns and cannonballs to add depth to battle
